## Preliminary steps

### Get the MicroEJ SDK
The MicroEJ SDK is an Eclipse-based IDE used to build the VEE Port and the high-level applications. The SDK can be used to run the i.MX RT595 EVK simulator.

The MicroEJ SDK requires Java JDK. JDK version [depends on the MicroEJ SDK version](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDKUserGuide/systemRequirements.html).

* Install the JDK. You can download it on the [Java SE 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) page
* Install MicroEJ SDK 23.07. Please refer to [Download and Install – MicroEJ Documentation](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDKUserGuide/installSDKDistributionLatest.html#) and [Installer Repository](https://repository.microej.com/packages/SDK/23.07/)

This release has been tested with MicroEJ SDK 23.07 and Java JDK 11.


### Get Visual Studio Code and MCUXpresso Installer tool
VS Code is an IDE used to build, flash and debug embedded projects.

In this VEE Port release, VS Code is used to build the firmware that will be flashed to target. VS Code project uses the VEE Port and high level applications built by the MicroEJ SDK.

* You can download VS Code IDE [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* Start VS Code and install the [MCUXpresso for VS Code](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-for-visual-studio-code:MCUXPRESSO-VSC?tid=vanMCUXPRESSO-VSC) extension package.
* Install the [MCUXpresso VS Code package dependencies](https://github.com/nxp-mcuxpresso/vscode-for-mcux/wiki/Dependency-Installation) to support the full development flow.

### MCUXpresso Installer tool

Using previously installed MCUXpresso Installer tool, need to install following tools that are used during compilation/debug:

* CMake, Ninja, West and ARM GNU Toolchain under MCUXpresso SDK Developer
* LinkServer under its own section
* SEGGER J-Link under its own section (if optional J-Link is used)

These tools can also be installed independently, MCUXpresso installer tool is just providing a convenient way to install them.
In case of standalone installation, following versions need to be installed:

* CMake version 3.27 minimum
* ARM GNU Toolchain version 13.2.1 minimum
* LinkServer version 1.6.133 minimum




## Fetch the source code

Clone the repository with the following command:

```
mkdir nxpvee-mimxrt595-prj
cd nxpvee-mimxrt595-prj
west init -m https://github.com/nxp-mcuxpresso/nxp-vee-imxrt595-evk .
west update
```
you will get


```
.west nxp-vee-rt595
```


## MicroEJ IDE project setup
### Import the project in a new workspace
Launch MicroEJ SDK and create a blank workspace.

Import the cloned repository as an existing project:

![Import...](Documentation/pictures/common/sdk_import.png)

![Existing Projects Into Workspace](Documentation/pictures/common/sdk_existing_project.png)

Then select all projects from the repository.

![Projects List](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_projects_list.png)

The package explorer view should look like this:

![Package Explorer](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_package_explorer.png)

### VEE Port Build
The VEE Port for the board is the first thing to build with the IDE.
For demonstration purposes, one of the release examples uses a mockup (more details follow in the native functions description). 
The mockup is a dependency of the VEE Port and must therefore be built beforehand.


#### Build the mockup
Right click on the mockup project and select `Build Module`:

![Build mockup](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_build_mock.png)

#### Build the VEE Port
Once the mockup dependency is resolved, the VEE Port can be built by using [VEE Port Build](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/VEEPortingGuide/platformCreation.html#platform-build) instructions.
Right-click on the configuration project and select `Build Module`:

![Build platform](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_build_platform.png)

Building the platform will populate the initally empty `MIMXRT595-evk_platform-CM4hardfp_GCC48-2.0.0` project which will be used to build VEE applications.
Under the `source` folder of the VEE Port, you will find the following files: 
* The C header files of the native needed by the VEE Port libraries are located in the `include` folder.
* The Java API of the VEE Port libraries is located in the `javaAPIS` folder.
* The jar files of the VEE Port libraries are located in the `javaLibs` folder.
* The Simulation files are located in the `S3` and `mocks` folders. 
* The VEE core, the MicroJVM, and some tools.

## Build and run applications using the MicroEJ SDK IDE

Two example VEE applications are provided with this release.


Application `SimpleGFX` displays three moving rectangles using the [MicroUI API](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/ApplicationDeveloperGuide/UI/MicroUI/index.html#section-app-microui). The coordinates of the rectangles are calculated in C native functions.


Application `AnimatedMascot` draws an animated [Android Vectordrawable](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/graphics/vector-drawable-resources) image. It uses the RT595's GCNanoLite-V as an accelerator.


### Build and run the applications in simulation mode
To run applications in simulation mode, right-click on the apps project and select `Run As -> MicroEJ Application`:

![Run As MicroEJ Application](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_run_as_microej_app.png)


The IDE will prompt which application should be built: either `SimpleGFX` or `AnimatedMascot`:

![Select Java Application](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_choose_app.png)

Choose the application. Then run the application in simulation mode by choosing the mode _(SIM)_:


![Choose build mode](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_choose_app_mode.png)


Here is the `AnimatedMascot` application running in simulation:

![Animated Mascot](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_sim_mascot.png)

### Modify the `AnimatedMascot` application
Now we will show you how easy it is to modify and test your Java application on the Simulator. 

To do so, we will modify the background color of the `AnimatedMascot` application:

* Open the `AnimatedMascot.java` file located in the `microej/apps/src/main/java/com/nxp/animatedMascot` folder. 
*  It sets the background color line 57. Replace the following line: 
```
g.setColor(Colors.BLACK);
```
by 
```
g.setColor(Colors.GREEN);
```
* Follow [Run the applications in simulation mode](#build-and-run-the-applications-in-simulation-mode) instructions to launch the modified application on the Simulator.

Here is the modified `AnimatedMascot` application running in simulation:

![Modified Animated Mascot](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_sim_modified_mascot.png)


## Build and run applications on your i.MX RT595 EVK


### Board Setup
![Setup](Documentation/pictures/RT595/imxrt595evk-setup.jpg)

Setup the [i.MX RT595 EVK](https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/i-mx-rt595-evaluation-kit:MIMXRT595-EVK): 
* Check that the dip switches (SW7) are set to OFF, OFF and ON (ISP0, ISP1, ISP2).
* Ensure jumpers JP18 and JP19 are closed.
* Remove jumper JP4.
* Connect the micro-USB cable to J40 to power the board.
* To use JLink probe ensure jumpers JP17 and JP19 are open, connect the board using J38.

The USB connection is used as a serial console for the SoC, as a CMSIS-DAP debugger and as a power input for the board.

MicroEJ VEE Port uses the virtual UART from the i.MX RT595 EVK USB port. A COM port is automatically mounted when the board is plugged into a computer using a USB cable. All board logs are available through this COM port.

The COM port uses the following parameters:

| Baudrate | Data bits bits | Parity bits | Stop bits | Flow control |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 115200     | 8     | None     | 1     | None     |



### Get an evaluation license
A license is required to build an embedded application. 

A MicroEJ license is required to build high-level applications and the VEE Port for target hardware.

Evaluation licenses can be obtained for free. Please follow [the instructions from MicroEJ](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDKUserGuide/licenses.html#evaluation-license).

With an evaluation license, you can build high-level applications with no limitation in simulation mode. However, applications built with an evaluation license will run for a limited time on target hardware.

Evaluation licenses must be renewed periodically (every month).

**Important note**: applications built with an evaluation license will freeze after a random period of time. A production license is necessary to have a fully working application on the target.


### Build the applications for target
With the MicroEJ SDK IDE, simply run the application the same way than [in simulation](#build-and-run-the-applications-in-simulation-mode) but by choosing the mode _(EMB)_.

#### Output of the build
The build will produce two artifacts:

* *microejapp.o*: the linked managed code application.
* *microejruntime.a*: the VEE core.

These artifacts are copied to the BSP project in the directory `projects/microej/platform/lib`.

### Build the firmware for target hardware using VS Code



#### Load the project into VS Code
Launch VS Code IDE and click on `File -> Add Folder to Workspace...`

![Add Folder to Workspace](Documentation/pictures/common/vscode_load_project.jpg)

Navigate to the nxp-vee-rt595 path then click `Add`.

From here you can compile and debug the project as any other C project.

To do so you need to configure then build the CMake project by following the steps below:

#### Select a Preset
Open the Command Palette (`CTRL + SHIFT + p`) and run `CMake: Select Configure Preset` to select the build mode you wish to use.

By default, you can select `debug` variant.


![VScode select build variant](Documentation/pictures/common/vscode_select_preset.jpg)

This can also be done by using Projects section from MCUXpresso for VS code" view, and choose appropriate build as default.

![VScode Projects view](Documentation/pictures/common/vscode_projects_view.jpg)

#### Configure the project
Open the Command Palette (`CTRL + SHIFT + p`) and run `CMake: Configure`.

![VScode select configure](Documentation/pictures/common/vscode_select_configure.jpg)

#### Configure the bsp features

Compilation flags are located on `./bsp/projects/nxpvee-ui/armgcc/CMakePresets.json`.
To enable any desired features, please edit `CMakePresets.json` file (and reload preset & re-configure if needed).



#### Build the project
Open the Command Palette (`CTRL + SHIFT + p`) and run `CMake: Build`.

![VScode build project](Documentation/pictures/common/vscode_select_build.jpg)

You can connect VS Code to the board using the Serial Link USB or using a SEGGER J-Link probe.
Follow the [Board Hardware User Guide](#board-setup) for more information on how to connect the different debuggers.

Debug session can be started by pressing the `F5` key.

It is also possible to build and debug the project via the MCUXpresso plugin:

Right click on the project, then:

* `Build Selected` to compile
* `Debug` to debug

![VScode MCUXpresso build and debug project](Documentation/pictures/common/vscode_mcuxpr_build_debug.jpg)

Once the firmware is flashed, you should see the application running on the target.

<ins>Note:</ins>
It is possible to flash (without debug) via the MCUXpresso plugin by selecting `Flash the Selected Target`.  
In case of connection issue to the target, reset the debug probe selection via the MCUXpresso plugin:

* Select the MCUXpresso plugin in the left banner
* Right-click on the project name and select `Reset Probe Selection`
* Start the debug again

![VScode MCUXpresso reset probe selection](Documentation/pictures/common/vscode_reset_probe_selection.jpg)


## Run Demo Wearable VG application
The wearable VG demo application is a smart watch application developed by MicroEJ.

It features several watch faces and side applications such as heart rate monitoring, activity tracking, compass, and more.

The application uses [MicroUI](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/ApplicationDeveloperGuide/UI/MicroUI/index.html) and [MicroVG](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/ApplicationDeveloperGuide/UI/MicroVG/index.html) to exploit hardware's vector capabilities and to make a nice-looking/efficient user interface.

### Get the application
Download the Demo Wearable VG sources using the following command:
```
git clone -b 1.0.1 https://github.com/MicroEJ/Demo-Wearable-VG.git
```

If you don’t have Git installed, you can download the source code directly from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicroEJ/Demo-Wearable-VG/tree/1.0.1). Then you can click on `Code > Download ZIP`.

Import the projects in the SDK:

* Select `File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace`.
* Point Select root directory to where you cloned the sources.
* Click on the `Finish` button.

The application projects `watchface-flower`, `watchface-flower-lp`, `watchface-sport`, `watch-util` and `watch-vg` are imported in your workspace. After dependencies resolution it should compile without errors.

###  Run the application in simulation mode
To run the application in simulation mode, , right-click on the `watch-vg` project and select `Run As -> MicroEJ Application`.

Then run the application in simulation mode by choosing the mode _(SIM)_:

![Choose Build Mode Demo Wearable](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_choose_app_mode_demo_wearable.png)

Here is the Demo Wearable VG application running in simulation:

![Simulation Demo Wearable](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_sim_demo_wearable.png)

To know more about how this demo works, please have a look at its [Application flow](https://github.com/MicroEJ/Demo-Wearable-VG/blob/1.0.1/watch-vg/README.md#application-flow).

### Run the application on your i.MX RT595 EVK
To run the application, simply run the application the same way than [in simulation](#run-the-application-in-simulation-mode) but by choosing the mode _(EMB)_.

Then follow [Build the firmware for the target hardware](#build-the-firmware-for-target-hardware-using-vs-code) instructions to launch the application on the board.


## Switching to a production license
To switch to a production license, please contact your NXP representative.



## Alternative: build and run from command line
This has only been tested on Linux.

A set of makefiles is provided to build either the whole project (VEE Port, high level application, firmware) or the final firmware from command line instead of using the MicroEJ / MCUXpresso IDE.
This can be useful for continuous integration or to get a more automated environment during development.

To access the top level makefile:
```
cd nxp-vee-rt595
```

### Requirements for building from command line

#### C toolchain
Make sure that the `ARMGCC_DIR` environment variable is set to the toolchain directory. 
If not, you must add it:

Linux:
```
export ARMGCC_DIR=<PATH_TO_GCC>/arm-gnu-toolchain-13.2.Rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/
```

<ins>Note:</ins>
Need at least ARM GNU toolchain version >= 13.2.1

#### CMake
The build system used to generate the firmware is based on CMake.

Linux: to install CMake on a Debian based distro, run:
```
sudo apt install cmake
```

<ins>Note:</ins>
Need at least cmake version >= 3.27

#### Make
Linux: to install GNU Make on a Debian based distro, run:
```
sudo apt install make
```

### Populate a Build Kit
It is necessary to export a Build Kit from the MicroEJ SDK IDE. This Build Kit is used by the makefile to build the VEE Port and the high level applications.

The Build Kit is bundled with the SDK and can be exported using the following steps:
```
    Select File > Export > MicroEJ > Module Manager Build Kit,
    Choose an empty Target directory, `i.e. ${HOME}/microej/BuildKit `
    Click on the Finish button.

### Using default evaluation license
Please follow [Install the License Key](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDKUserGuide/licenses.html#install-the-license-key) to be able to use make with an evaluation key

### Needed Environment variables
In order to compile correctly you will need to export

```
export MICROEJ_BUILDKIT_PATH_VAR=${HOME}/microej/BuildKit
export ECLIPSE_HOME_VAR=${HOME}/MicroEJ/MicroEJ-SDK-21.11/rcp/
```

you can also specify a partial repository, when needed (for example if you need libraries that are not yet public)
```
export MODULE_REPOSITORY_SETTINGS_FILE_VAR=${HOME}/microej/microej-partial-repository/ivysettings.xml
```

if you are using LinkServer to flash your board, append your path with the following command:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/LinkServer_1.6.133/binaries/:/usr/local/LinkServer_1.6.133/
```

<ins>Note:</ins>
Use full path names in above environment variables, do not use special character `~` to represent your home directory.
LinkServer version 1.6.133 is depicted on the command line because this version is working fine, it may work with other versions as well but this is not tested.

## Tutorial: Using native C functions from the high level application
Some functions directly used by the high-level application can be implemented in C. It is called the [Native Interface Mechanism](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/VEEPortingGuide/native.html).

A native method is declared in the Application but is implemented in the native world. So a native declaration requires a C and Java implementation for the Simulator. You can find an example of a native method on [this page](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/VEEPortingGuide/sni.html?highlight=native#example).

You can have custom natives specific to the Java application (less portable between VEE Ports but fast execution). On the other hand, you can use native methods provided by [Foundation Libraries](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/glossary.html#term-Foundation-Library) (Portable between VEE Ports but takes more time at the execution). 

The SimpleGFX application uses of C native function to calculate rectangles' coordinates (mainly for demonstration's sake).

### Declaring and using native functions in the Java world
It is recommended to store all your native methods in the same public class. This public class contains methods with the same parameters as the C native functions.

The name of the C function is `Java_<package_name>_<class_name>_<method_name>`. Any underscore (`_`) character in `package_name`, `class_name`, or `function_name` is replaced by `_1`. Dots (`.`) are replaced by underscores `_`.

For these reasons, it is handy to stick to Java naming conventions and use camel case for class and method names and lowercase only package names.

For example:
````
package com.nxp.application;

public class MyClassNatives {
	/* package */ native static int NativeFunction(int a);
};
````

This can be used in the application source code this way:
````
j = MyClassNatives.NativeFunction(i);
````

### Implementing the native functions in C world
The native functions are implemented in C, with a name deriving from the package name and the native class name.
In the previous example, we would have:
````
int Java_com_nxp_application_MyClassNatives_NativeFunction(int a)
{
    int i;

[...]

    return i;
}
````

When you implement a native method, it is recommended to use the type of `sni.h` rather than the native type. This ensures type consistency between Java and C. 
You could use `jint` instead of `int` in the example above.

The `sni.h` file is located on `nxp-vee-rt595/bsp/projects/microej/platform/inc` folder.

### Implementing a mockup of the native functions for the simulator
Mockup functions are used to simulate the behavior of native functions when using the MicroEJ SDK Simulator. Mockups are detailed in the [MicroEJ website](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/PlatformDeveloperGuide/mock.html).

They are implementated in a different MicroEJ SDK project (`microej/mock`).

The name of the file containing the mockup functions is supposed to be the same as the one where the native functions are declared in the application project (e.g. `SimpleGFXNatives.java`).

The file may look like this:
````
package com.nxp.application;

public class MyClassNatives {
    static int NativeFunction(int a) {
        int i;

        [...]

        return i;
    }
};
````

Please note that this project mockup must be added as a dependency inside the VEE Port's `module.ivy` file. The `module.ivy` file is located in the `microej/vee-port-configuration` folder. You will find inside all the dependencies used by the VEE Port.  

![Mockup Declaration in platform](Documentation/pictures/RT595/sdk_mockup_declaration_in_platform.png)

The `org` and `name` fields can be found inside the mockup's `module.ivy` file (respectively `organisation` and `module`):

![Mockup org and name declaration](Documentation/pictures/common/sdk_mockup_org_name_declaration.png)

After any modification to the mockup project, you need to rebuild the mock (right click on the mock project and select `Build Module`) and the platform (see [Build the platform](#build-the-vee-port)).

## Troubleshooting

### Setup error

#### West update and "Filename too long" issue

On Windows, fetching the source code may trigger the following fatal error:
```error: unable to create file [...]: Filename too long.```

To avoid this, git configuration needs to be updated to handle long file names:

Start Git Bash as Administrator.

Run following command:
```git config --system core.longpaths true```


#### West update and "PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied" issue

If you get the error `PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied`, please consider the following procedure :

```
rm .west
cd nxp-vee-rt595
west init -l
cd ..
west update
```


### License Error when building application

#### [M65] - License check failed

If you have the following error `[M65] - License check failed [tampered (3)]`, please follow the steps on this [page](https://forum.microej.com/t/license-check-fail-workaround-on-microej-sdk-with-jdk-version-8u351/1182)


### Flash config issue for i.MX RT595 EVK Rev. D

I has been noticed an issue with the flash operating frequency on some i.MX RT595 EVK Rev. D. To fix this issue, please set to 50MHz the frequency line 46 of the `flash_config.c` file located in `nxpvee-mimxrt595-evk-round-bsp\sdk\boards\evkmimxrt595\flash_config` folder. 

Replace:
```
.serialClkFreq   = kFlexSpiSerialClk_60MHz,
```
By:

```
.serialClkFreq   = kFlexSpiSerialClk_50MHz,
```
