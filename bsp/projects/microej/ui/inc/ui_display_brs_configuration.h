 * @brief Defines the "predraw" strategy that consists in restoring the back buffer with the

 * This strategy requires the available number of back buffers (i.e. the number of buffers
 * where the drawings can be performed):
 *
 * 		#define UI_DISPLAY_BRS_DRAWING_BUFFER_COUNT (2u)
 *
 * This strategy manages, by default, two or three back buffers. Its implementation can be
 * easily modified to manage more back buffers. An error is thrown if the code is not modified
 * and the number of back buffers is higher than three.
 *
 * A warning is thrown if there is only one back buffer because this strategy is optimized
 * for two or more back buffers. However, this strategy works with only one buffer but it
 * is a little bit too complex for this use case.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - The maximum number of rectangles given as parameter to the function LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_flush()
 * is equal to UI_RECT_COLLECTION_MAX_LENGTH.
 * - This BRS takes in consideration the option UI_DISPLAY_BRS_FLUSH_SINGLE_RECTANGLE.
